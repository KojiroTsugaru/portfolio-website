    longDescription: `
      Transform your time management with Puctee, the social-accountability iOS app that will help you prevent being late for appointments with friends. By allowing you to set predefined penalties when creating events, Puctee harnesses 
      peer pressure and behavioral economics to dramatically improve punctuality. Under the hood, iOS frontend is 
      powered by SwiftUI, while a FastAPI backend running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway powers secure, serverless 
      operations; PostgreSQL on RDS stores your data; and JWT authentication plus push notifications ensure reliable 
      coordination. With its clean, intuitive interface and science-backed approach, Puctee not only helps 
      you arrive on time todayâ€”it evolves with you, making every commitment count.
